'''
Write a program that makes the user guess a particular number between
1 and 100.
Save the number to be guessed in a
variable called magic_number.

If the user guesses a number higher than the secret number, 
you should say Too high!. Similarly, you should say Too low! if they guess
a number lower than the secret number.
Once they guess the number, say Correct!
